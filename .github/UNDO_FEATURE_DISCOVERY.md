# üîÑ **Bell & Barks: Global "Undo" Feature - Technical Discovery**

## **Executive Summary**
As CTO, I've conducted a comprehensive technical discovery for implementing a global "undo" functionality in the Bell & Barks platform. This feature requires careful architectural planning to ensure data integrity and optimal user experience.

## **üéØ Feature Scope Definition**

### **Core Questions Requiring Clarification:**

#### **1. Undo Scope & Context**
- **User Actions**: Which user actions should be undoable?
  - Pet search/filter changes?
  - Form submissions (adoption applications)?
  - Navigation changes?
  - Profile updates?
  - Shopping cart modifications?

- **Data Persistence**: Should undo work across:
  - Browser sessions (persist after reload)?
  - Device changes (mobile to desktop)?
  - User logout/login cycles?

#### **2. Undo Depth & Limitations**
- **History Depth**: How many actions can be undone?
  - Last 5 actions?
  - Last 10 actions?
  - Session-based limit?
  - Time-based limit (last 30 minutes)?

- **Action Types**: What constitutes an "undoable action"?
  - UI state changes only?
  - Database modifications?
  - External API calls?
  - File uploads?

#### **3. User Experience & Interface**
- **Trigger Method**: How do users activate undo?
  - Ctrl+Z keyboard shortcut?
  - Floating undo button?
  - Menu option?
  - Toast notification with undo button?

- **Visual Feedback**: How do we communicate undo availability?
  - Action history dropdown?
  - Breadcrumb-style undo chain?
  - Simple "Undo" button with description?

#### **4. Technical Implementation Scope**
- **State Management**: Which application state needs undo capability?
  - Global app state (Redux/Zustand)?
  - Component-level state?
  - URL/routing state?
  - Form state management?

- **Data Synchronization**: How do we handle undo with backend data?
  - Optimistic updates with rollback?
  - Server-side undo history?
  - Conflict resolution strategies?

## **üèóÔ∏è Proposed Technical Architecture**

### **Option A: Client-Side State Management**
```javascript
// Undo Manager Service
class UndoManager {
  constructor() {
    this.history = [];
    this.currentIndex = -1;
    this.maxHistorySize = 10;
  }
  
  pushAction(action) {
    // Add action to history
    // Implement undo/redo logic
  }
  
  undo() {
    // Revert last action
  }
  
  canUndo() {
    // Check if undo is available
  }
}
```

### **Option B: Event Sourcing Pattern**
```javascript
// Event Store for user actions
const eventStore = {
  events: [],
  aggregateState: {},
  
  dispatch(event) {
    // Store event and update state
  },
  
  replay(toEventIndex) {
    // Rebuild state up to specific event
  }
}
```

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Client-side for UI actions
- Server-side for critical data changes
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability

## **üìä Implementation Complexity Analysis**

### **Low Complexity (Quick Win)**
- **Form field undo**: Simple input field restoration
- **Filter state undo**: Reset search filters
- **UI theme/preference undo**: Visual state changes

### **Medium Complexity**
- **Navigation undo**: Browser history integration
- **Shopping cart undo**: State synchronization
- **Multi-step form undo**: Complex form state management

### **High Complexity**
- **Database transaction undo**: Data integrity concerns
- **File upload undo**: External resource management
- **Cross-user action undo**: Collaborative features

## **üö® Technical Considerations & Risks**

### **Data Integrity Risks**
- Race conditions in multi-user scenarios
- Database consistency during rollbacks
- External API state synchronization

### **Performance Concerns**
- Memory usage for action history
- Large state object serialization
- Network overhead for server-side undo

### **User Experience Challenges**
- Confusing undo behavior in complex workflows
- Unclear action boundaries
- Accidental undo triggering

## **üí° Recommended Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Implement basic UI state undo (filters, preferences)
- Add keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl+Z)
- Create undo notification system

### **Phase 2: Forms & Navigation (Week 2)**
- Add form field undo capability
- Implement navigation/routing undo
- Create visual undo history indicator

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)**
- Add persistent undo across sessions
- Implement server-side critical action undo
- Add collaborative undo handling

## **üîç Critical Questions for Product Decision**

### **Business Logic Questions:**
1. **Which pet adoption actions are most critical to make undoable?**
2. **Should users be able to undo submitted adoption applications?**
3. **How does undo interact with real-time pet availability?**
4. **Should undo work across different pet categories/pages?**

### **User Experience Questions:**
5. **What's the expected user mental model for undo in pet adoption?**
6. **Should undo be discoverable or hidden until needed?**
7. **How do we handle undo conflicts (pet becomes unavailable)?**

### **Technical Constraints:**
8. **What's the acceptable memory/performance overhead?**
9. **Should undo state persist in localStorage or server-side?**
10. **How do we handle undo in offline scenarios?**

## **üìã Next Steps Required**

1. **Product Requirements**: Define specific undoable actions priority
2. **UX Design**: Create undo interaction patterns and visual design
3. **Technical Architecture**: Choose implementation approach based on requirements
4. **Development Timeline**: Estimate implementation phases
5. **Testing Strategy**: Define undo functionality test scenarios
